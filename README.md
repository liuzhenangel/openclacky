OpenClacky = Lovable + Supabase

**OpenClacky** is a CLI tool for building full-stack web applications — no technical background required. We spent months crafting a **Rails for AI** full-stack architecture that is fully production-ready, with one-click deployment, isolated dev/production environments, and automatic backups.

OpenClacky's goal is to deliver the best balance of **AI quality, AI cost, and AI speed**.

## Quick start

```bash
$ openclacky
```

- `/config` — Set your API key, model, and base URL
- `/new <project-name>` — Create a new project
- Type your requirements and start building

## Why OpenClacky?

## Installation

### Method 1: One-line Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clacky-ai/open-clacky/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Method 2: RubyGems

**Requirements:** Ruby >= 3.1.0

```bash
gem install openclacky
```

## Configuration

Before using Clacky, you need to configure your settings:

```bash
$ openclacky

- /config
```

You'll be prompted to enter:
- **API Key**: Your API key from any OpenAI-compatible provider
- **Model**: Model name
- **Base URL**: OpenAI-compatible API endpoint

## Usage

Run an autonomous AI agent in interactive mode. The agent can use tools to complete tasks and runs in a continuous loop, allowing you to have multi-turn conversations with tool use capabilities.

```bash
# Start interactive agent (will prompt for tasks)
clacky agent

# Start with an initial task, then continue interactively
clacky agent "Create a README.md file for my project"

# Auto-approve all tool executions
clacky agent --mode=auto_approve

# Work in a specific project directory
clacky agent --path /path/to/project

#### Permission Modes

- `auto_approve` - Automatically execute all tools (use with caution)
- `confirm_safes` - Auto-approve read-only tools, confirm edits
- `plan_only` - Generate plan without executing

#### Agent Options

```bash
--path PATH                    # Project directory (defaults to current directory)
--mode MODE                    # Permission mode
--verbose                      # Show detailed output
```

#### Built-in Tools

- **todo_manager** - Manage TODO items for task planning and tracking
- **file_reader** - Read file contents
- **write** - Create or overwrite files
- **edit** - Make precise edits to existing files
- **glob** - Find files by pattern matching
- **grep** - Search file contents with regex
- **shell** - Execute shell commands
- **web_search** - Search the web for information
- **web_fetch** - Fetch and parse web page content

## Examples

### Agent Examples

```bash
# Start interactive agent session
clacky agent
# Then type tasks interactively:
# > Create a TODO.md file with 3 example tasks
# > Now add more items to the TODO list
# > exit

# Auto-approve mode for trusted operations
clacky agent --mode=auto_approve --path ~/my-project
# > Count all lines of code
# > Create a summary report
# > exit

# Using TODO manager for complex tasks
clacky agent "Implement a new feature with user authentication"
# Agent will:
# 1. Use todo_manager to create a task plan
# 2. Add todos: "Research current auth patterns", "Design auth flow", etc.
# 3. Complete each todo step by step
# 4. Mark todos as completed as work progresses
# > exit
```

## Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clacky-ai/open-clacky.git
cd open-clacky
bundle install
bin/clacky
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Testing Agent Features

After making changes to agent-related functionality (tools, system prompts, agent logic, etc.), test with this command:

```bash
# Test agent with a complex multi-step task using auto-approve mode
echo "Create a simple calculator project with index.html, style.css, and script.js files" | \
  bin/clacky agent --mode=auto_approve --path=tmp --max-iterations=20

# Expected: Agent should plan tasks (add TODOs), execute them (create files),
# and track progress (mark TODOs as completed)
```
